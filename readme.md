# npg - new pg

This is a pager program written around 1980 because the Unix v6 `pg` (or was that Unix v7?) was missing some useful features. Utilities like `more` and `less` were still far in the future.

It might be compileable on Unix systems from that era, but no guarantees.

Thanks go to Geert Rolf for finding this.
